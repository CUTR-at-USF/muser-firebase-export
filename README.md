# muser-firebase-export ![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/muser-firebase-export/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)

Java application to export music listening data collected with the [MUSER Android app](https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/MUSER). Data is exported from Firebase Firestore to a CSV file.

## Setup

You'll need the following installed to build the project:
* [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) or higher
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## Build

To build the application use `mvn clean package` command. This command will create a jar file (i.e., muser-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) under the target folder.

## Setup Firebase Account

Generate a admin private-key json file (e.g., `admin-key.json`) for your service account. To generate the key file follow the instructions in Firebase setup page.

## Run

To run the application use `java -jar` command and pass the `admin-key.json` file as an argument: 

```
java -jar target/muser-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -keyFile /path/to/file/fileName.json
```

### Additional Optional Command Line Arguments

* `-userId <userId>` Takes a user id as an argument and performs the analysis for that specific user. Example usage:
`-userId abcdef`.
* `-startDate <mm-dd-yyyy> -endDate <mm-dd-yyyy>` Takes two dates as argument and performs the analysis for activities in
  the specific date range. The filter will assume the dates in the UTC timezone. Example usage:
  `-startDate 05-05-2021 -endDate 07-15-2021` will perform the analysis from May 05, 2021 00:00:00, to July 15, 2021 00:00:00.
